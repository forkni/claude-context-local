# .gitattributes - Git Merge Strategies
# Created: 2025-10-03
# Purpose: Control merge behavior for dual-branch workflow (main/development)
# NOTE: Last matching pattern wins! Specific patterns must come AFTER general patterns.

# ============================================================================
# GENERAL PATTERNS (APPLY FIRST)
# Use "diff3" strategy for better conflict resolution
# ============================================================================

# Python source files (general - will be overridden for tests/)
*.py merge=diff3

# Batch scripts
*.bat merge=diff3

# PowerShell scripts
*.ps1 merge=diff3

# Configuration files (general - pytest.ini will be overridden)
*.json merge=diff3
*.yaml merge=diff3
*.yml merge=diff3
*.toml merge=diff3
*.ini merge=diff3
*.cfg merge=diff3

# Documentation (general - specific docs will be overridden)
*.md merge=diff3

# ============================================================================
# SPECIFIC PATTERNS (OVERRIDE GENERAL)
# ============================================================================

# Changelog should combine (not diff3)
CHANGELOG.md merge=union

# FILES THAT SHOULD NEVER MERGE FROM DEVELOPMENT TO MAIN
# Use "ours" strategy (keep main's version during merge)

# Complete test suite (development-only) - OVERRIDES *.py pattern
tests/** merge=ours

# Test configuration (development-only) - OVERRIDES *.ini pattern
pytest.ini merge=ours

# Development-only documentation (implementation details) - OVERRIDES *.md pattern
docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md merge=ours
docs/GPU_MEMORY_LEAK_FIX.md merge=ours
docs/PER_MODEL_INDICES_IMPLEMENTATION.md merge=ours
docs/PER_MODEL_INDICES_PLAN.md merge=ours
docs/Current_State.md merge=ours
docs/GIT_WORKFLOW_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md merge=ours
docs/GIT_WORKFLOW_CRITICAL_REVIEW.md merge=ours

# ============================================================================
# NOTES:
# - "ours" = keep current branch's version (main keeps its version)
# - "union" = combine both versions (useful for changelogs)
# - "diff3" = show common ancestor in conflicts (easier resolution)
# ============================================================================
