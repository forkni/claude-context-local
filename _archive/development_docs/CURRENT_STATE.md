<log>
  Great! The import fixes resolved 3/5 test failures. We now have only 2 minor test failures left (related to optimization and timing
  tracking). Most importantly, all the core functionality tests are passing.
  </log>
  - could we fix that as well? \

  ● Analysis Summary

  You're absolutely right - this is a mess! Here's what I found:

  Current Script Confusion:

  1. scripts/install.sh - Linux/Mac script from original repo (uses bash)
  2. scripts/powershell/install-windows.ps1 - Only creates venv, doesn't install dependencies!
  3. scripts/batch/install_pytorch_cuda.bat - Actually does the full installation (confusing name!)

  Problems:

- Naming is terrible - "install_pytorch_cuda.bat" sounds like it only installs PyTorch, but it actually installs everything
- Multiple incomplete scripts - The PowerShell script doesn't finish the job
- Platform confusion - Mixed Linux/Mac and Windows scripts in same folder structure

> Combine everything into one clear install-windows.bat:  

- this is good idea and we can focus on this for now as we don't have ability to test it on Mac / Linux.
- So maybe it's a good way to mark this repo as 'Windows only' for example.
- anyways, what if user doesn't want to enable CUDA or don't have it, we need to include CPU-only option as well and test it's
  working.

- I want you to think hard through it and create comprehansive plan to steamline installation process on Windows machine,

- include these points too:

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants a comprehensive plan to streamline the Windows installation process, including:

  1. A single unified installer for Windows
  2. CPU-only option for users without CUDA
  3. Performance evaluation and benchmarking
  4. Updated batch file menu with hybrid search options
  5. Documentation updates

  I need to think through this carefully and create a well-organized plan that addresses all these points.

  Key considerations:

- Windows-only focus (mark repo as Windows-only or Windows-primary)
- CPU vs CUDA installation options
- Testing and verification
- Performance benchmarking for hybrid search
- User-friendly menu system
- Clear documentation

  Let me create a comprehensive plan that addresses all these aspects.

● Comprehensive Plan: Streamline Windows Installation & Complete Hybrid Search Integration

  After analyzing the current state, here's my comprehensive plan to streamline everything for Windows users:

  Phase 1: Unified Windows Installer

  1.1 Create install-windows.bat (Main Installer)

  Features:

- Auto-detect CUDA availability (nvidia-smi check)
- Offer installation modes:
    [1] Full Installation with CUDA Support
    [2] CPU-Only Installation (no CUDA required)
    [3] Update Existing Installation
    [4] Repair/Verify Installation

- Installation steps:
    1. Check Python 3.11+ availability
    2. Create/update virtual environment
    3. Install UV package manager
    4. Detect GPU/CUDA availability
    5. Install PyTorch (CUDA or CPU version based on selection)
    6. Install all dependencies including hybrid search (rank-bm25, nltk)
    7. Download NLTK data (stopwords, punkt)
    8. Verify installation with quick test
    9. Optional: Configure Claude Code integration
    10. Show success summary with next steps

  1.2 Remove/Archive Confusing Scripts

- Move scripts/install.sh → scripts/legacy/install-linux.sh.bak
- Delete incomplete scripts/powershell/install-windows.ps1
- Rename install_pytorch_cuda.bat → scripts/legacy/pytorch-cuda-only.bat.bak

  1.3 Installation Verification System

  Create verify-installation.bat:

- Check Python version

  3.1 Create evaluation/run_benchmark.py

  Features:

- Load a sample codebase (or use test_td_project)
- Run identical queries through:
  - Hybrid search (default)
  - Semantic-only search
  - BM25-only search
- Measure for each:
  - Query response time
  - Result accuracy (F1 score if ground truth available)
  - Token usage estimation
  - Memory consumption
- Generate comparison report with charts
- Save results to evaluation/benchmark_results/

  3.2 Create evaluation/quick_token_test.py

  Simple demonstration:

- Run 5 common queries

- Display percentage savings
- Output easy-to-understand summary

  3.3 Create benchmark.bat Wrapper

  Simple batch file to run benchmarks from menu:

- Set up environment

  Phase 4: CPU-Only Support Enhancement

  4.1 Modify Configuration System

  Add to search/config.py:

- device_preference: "cuda" | "cpu" | "auto"
- force_cpu_mode: bool
- cuda_not_available_fallback: bool

  4.2 Update Embedder for CPU Mode

  Ensure embeddings/embedder.py:

- Properly detects and respects CPU-only mode
- Adjusts batch sizes for CPU processing
- Shows appropriate warnings/info about performance

  4.3 Update FAISS for CPU Mode

  Ensure search/indexer.py:

- Uses faiss-cpu when CUDA not available
- Adjusts index parameters for CPU performance
- Clear logging about which backend is used

  Phase 5: Documentation Overhaul

  5.1 Update README.md

  Add sections:

- "🆕 What's New in v2.0" - Highlight hybrid search
- "💻 Windows Installation" - Clear single command
- "🚀 Quick Start" - 3-step process
- "📊 Performance" - Actual benchmark results
- "🔧 Requirements" - Clear CPU vs GPU options

  5.2 Create WINDOWS_QUICKSTART.md

  Contents:

  1. One-line installation command
  2. Screenshots of menu system
  3. Common use cases
  4. Troubleshooting guide
  5. Performance tips

  5.3 Update INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md

  Restructure to:

- Windows Installation (Primary)
- Configuration Options
