#### Technical Implementation
```python
# New modules needed:
search/hybrid_searcher.py  # Hybrid search orchestrator
search/bm25_index.py       # BM25 sparse index manager

- **mcp_server/server.py**: Add search mode parameter (hybrid/dense/sparse)

#### Expected Benefits
- 40% better retrieval precision
- Handles both keyword and semantic queries effectively
- Better for code search (variable names, exact matches)

#### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for BM25 indexing and search
- Integration tests comparing hybrid vs. dense-only results
- Benchmark tests measuring retrieval quality (precision, recall, F1)

- Store snapshots in `~/.claude_code_search/merkle/{project_hash}.json`

#### Expected Benefits
- 10x faster re-indexing for large projects
- Only process changed files (added/modified/deleted)
- Reduced CPU and memory usage during updates
- Better developer experience with near-instant updates

#### GPU-Specific Benefits
- 80-90% reduction in GPU compute cycles for re-indexing
- Lower VRAM usage (process only delta chunks)
