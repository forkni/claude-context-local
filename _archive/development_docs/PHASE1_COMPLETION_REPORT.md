## Performance Achievements

### Expected Benefits (Based on Zilliz Analysis)

#### Token Efficiency
- **39.4% reduction** in token usage vs BM25-only approaches
- **36.3% reduction** in tool calls through better targeting

## Technical Highlights

### 1. GPU-CPU Coordination
```python
# Optimal resource utilization
def _parallel_search(self, query, k, min_score, filters):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
        bm25_future = executor.submit(self._search_bm25, ...)  # CPU
        dense_future = executor.submit(self._search_dense, ...) # GPU
        return bm25_future.result(), dense_future.result()
```

### 2. Intelligent Change Detection
```python
# Only reindex what changed
changes = self.detect_changes(project_path)
if changes.has_changes():
    chunks_removed = self._remove_old_chunks(changes)
    chunks_added = self._add_new_chunks(changes)
```

### 3. Advanced Metrics Suite
```python
@dataclass
class SearchMetrics:
    precision: float    # Accuracy of retrieved results
    recall: float       # Coverage of relevant results
    f1_score: float     # Harmonic mean
    mrr: float         # Mean Reciprocal Rank
