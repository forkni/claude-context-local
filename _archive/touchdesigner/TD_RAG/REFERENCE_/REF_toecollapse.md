# toecollapse

A utility program included with TouchDesigner to collapse an expanded `.toe` file into a form readable by TouchDesigner. This can only be used on a `.toe` file that has been expanded into a collection of ascii files using [REF_toeexpand].

`toecollapse` can be found in the TouchDesigner installation directory which defaults to `C:\Program Files\Derivative\TouchDesignerxxx\bin`
