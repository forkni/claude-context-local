# toeexpand

A utility program included with TouchDesigner to expand a `.toe` file into a collection of ascii readable files. To reverse the expansion process, [REF_toecollapse] will convert the file(s) into a `.toe` file that can be read by TouchDesigner.

`toeexpand` can be found in the TouchDesigner installation directory which defaults to `C:\Program Files\Derivative\TouchDesignerxxx\bin`
