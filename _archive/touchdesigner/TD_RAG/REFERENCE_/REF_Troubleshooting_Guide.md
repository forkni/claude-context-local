## Overview

TouchDesigner's flexibility can lead to complex problems. This guide covers essential troubleshooting workflows and systematic approaches for identifying, diagnosing, and resolving issues in TouchDesigner projects.

**Key Distinction**: This guide focuses on systematic troubleshooting approaches and workflows. For Python debugging code and automated monitoring systems, see [PY_Debugging_Error_Handling](../PYTHON_/PY_Debugging_Error_Handling.md).

## Visual Error Identification

### Understanding TouchDesigner Error Markers

TouchDesigner provides visual feedback for errors through several mechanisms:

**Error Markers (Red Circles with Black X)**:
- Appear on operators with errors
- Click the error marker or middle-click the operator to see error details
- Errors inside components show on parent components as well
- Usually disappear immediately when the underlying issue is fixed

**Error Dialog Window**:
- Shows detailed error messages
- Provides context about what went wrong
- May suggest potential solutions
- Can be accessed via the error marker or Help â†’ Show Error Dialog

**Textport Output**:
- Real-time error reporting in the textport
- Use `debug()` commands to output diagnostic information
- Error messages often include operator paths and specific details

### Systematic Error Investigation Workflow

**Step 1: Identify Error Location**
1. Look for red error markers in the network
2. Start with the most upstream errors (closest to data sources)
3. Check parent components for child component errors
4. Note error patterns (multiple similar errors may indicate a systemic issue)

**Step 2: Gather Error Details**
1. Click on error markers to read full error messages
2. Check the textport for additional error context
3. Note the exact operator path and error type
4. Document any recent changes that might have caused the error

**Step 3: Analyze Error Context**
1. Check the operator's inputs - are they connected and valid?
2. Verify parameter values - are they within expected ranges?
3. Look at the data flow - is the input data in the expected format?
4. Consider external dependencies (files, network connections, hardware)

**Step 4: Apply Systematic Resolution**
1. Test with minimal input data
2. Temporarily bypass the problematic operator
3. Create a simple test case to isolate the issue
4. Check TouchDesigner forums or documentation for similar issues

## Network Debugging Strategies

### Data Flow Analysis

**Trace Data Path**:
1. Start from the source of your data (file, camera, generator)
2. Follow the data flow downstream, operator by operator
3. Use the middle-mouse button to view operator output at each stage
4. Look for unexpected data transformations or format changes

**Input Validation**:
- Check that input operators are receiving valid data
- Verify file paths exist and files are accessible
- Confirm network connections are active
- Test hardware devices are connected and functioning

**Parameter Verification**:
- Review critical parameters that affect data processing
- Check for parameter expressions that might be evaluating incorrectly
- Verify parameter links and bindings are working as expected
- Look for parameters that might have been accidentally changed

### Isolation Testing

**Component Isolation**:
1. Create a simple test network with just the problematic operator
2. Feed it with known-good test data
3. Verify the operator works in isolation
4. Gradually add complexity to identify the point of failure

**Bypass Testing**:
1. Temporarily bypass suspect operators
2. Use Switch operators to route around problematic sections
3. Compare results with and without suspect operators
4. Identify if the problem is in the operator itself or its configuration

## Crash Recovery and Prevention

### Safe Mode Operation

**Entering Safe Mode**:
1. Hold Shift while starting TouchDesigner to enter safe mode
2. Safe mode disables many features that might cause crashes
3. Use safe mode to recover projects that crash on startup
4. Save a recovery version before attempting to fix issues

**Safe Mode Limitations**:
- GLSL shaders may not compile
- Some operators may be disabled
- Performance will be reduced
- External dependencies may not load

### Crash Prevention Strategies

**Pre-emptive Measures**:
1. **Regular Saving**: Save frequently, especially before making major changes
2. **Incremental Backups**: Create dated backup copies of important projects
3. **Version Control**: Use external version control for critical projects
4. **Documentation**: Keep notes about recent changes and configurations

**High-Risk Operations**:
- Loading large files or datasets
- Connecting new hardware devices
- Installing new operators or plugins
- Making major network restructuring changes
- Working with complex GLSL shaders

### Recovery Workflows

**When TouchDesigner Crashes**:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Don't panic - TouchDesigner has good crash recovery
   - Check for auto-saved versions in the temp directory
   - Look for the most recent backup files
   
2. **Recovery Process**:
   - Restart TouchDesigner in safe mode if crashes persist
   - Load the most recent working version
   - Incrementally add back changes to identify the problematic element
   - Document what caused the crash for future avoidance

3. **Post-Recovery Analysis**:
   - Identify what changed since the last working version
   - Check system resources (memory, disk space)
   - Review error logs and crash reports
   - Consider if external factors (OS updates, driver changes) contributed

## Performance Troubleshooting

### Identifying Performance Issues

**Frame Rate Problems**:
- Monitor the frame rate indicator in TouchDesigner
- Look for frame rate drops during specific operations
- Check if performance issues are consistent or intermittent
- Note if problems occur during timeline playback vs. realtime

**Memory Issues**:
- Monitor memory usage in Task Manager / Activity Monitor
- Look for memory leaks (gradually increasing memory usage)
- Check for operations that consume excessive memory
- Consider 32-bit vs 64-bit TouchDesigner limitations

**GPU Performance**:
- Monitor GPU usage and memory
- Check for GPU driver issues
- Look for GLSL compilation errors
- Consider GPU compatibility with complex shaders

### Systematic Performance Investigation

**Step 1: Establish Baseline**
1. Note current frame rate and performance characteristics
2. Document system specifications and current load
3. Check for other applications consuming resources
4. Establish what constitutes acceptable performance for your use case

**Step 2: Isolate Problem Areas**
1. Use the Performance Monitor to identify slow operators
2. Temporarily disable sections of the network
3. Test with reduced resolution or simplified settings
4. Identify if the problem is CPU, GPU, or I/O related

**Step 3: Optimize Systematically**
1. Address the most significant performance bottlenecks first
2. Test one change at a time to measure impact
3. Consider trade-offs between quality and performance
4. Document successful optimizations for future reference

For detailed performance optimization techniques, see [PERF_Optimize](../PERFORMANCE_/PERF_Optimize.md).

## Hardware and External Dependencies

### Common Hardware Issues

**Audio Devices**:
- Check audio device selection in TouchDesigner preferences
- Verify audio drivers are up to date
- Test with different sample rates and buffer sizes
- Ensure exclusive access to audio devices when needed

**Video Devices**:
- Confirm cameras and capture devices are detected by the system
- Check video driver compatibility
- Test different video formats and resolutions
- Verify USB bandwidth for multiple devices

**Network Connections**:
- Test network connectivity with external tools
- Verify firewalls aren't blocking TouchDesigner
- Check for network timeouts and connection stability
- Consider network bandwidth limitations

### File and Path Issues

**Common File Problems**:
- File paths with special characters or spaces
- Network drive accessibility and permissions
- File format compatibility issues
- Missing or moved files

**Path Resolution**:
- Use relative paths when possible for project portability
- Check that referenced files exist and are accessible
- Consider path length limitations on some systems
- Use consistent path separators (forward vs. back slashes)

## Systematic Debugging Methodology

### The "Binary Search" Approach

When facing complex issues with many potential causes:

1. **Divide the Problem**: Split your network in half and test each section
2. **Isolate the Problem Half**: Focus on the section that contains the issue
3. **Repeat**: Continue dividing the problematic section until you find the specific cause
4. **Verify**: Once identified, confirm the fix resolves the original issue

### Documentation and Communication

**Problem Documentation**:
- Record exact error messages and steps to reproduce
- Note TouchDesigner version and system specifications
- Document what was changed recently
- Include screenshots or screen recordings of the issue

**Seeking Help**:
- Search TouchDesigner forums for similar issues
- Provide complete information when asking for help
- Share minimal test cases that demonstrate the problem
- Be specific about your expected vs. actual results

**Knowledge Sharing**:
- Document solutions for future reference
- Share successful troubleshooting methods with team members
