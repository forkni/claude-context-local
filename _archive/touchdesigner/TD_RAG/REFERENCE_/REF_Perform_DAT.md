## Summary

The Perform DAT logs various performance times in a Table DAT format. These benchmarks are similar to those reported by the [REF_PerformanceMonitor].

## Parameters - Perform Page

### Active

**Active** `active` - Turns logging on/off. The DAT will continuously log while Active is On.

### Active Pulse

**Active Pulse** `activepulse` - Use resetpulse button to grab a single frame snapshot.

### Trigger Mode

**Trigger Mode** `triggermode` - Offers two options for when to trigger a refresh of the logs.

### Trigger Threshold

**Trigger Threshold** `triggerthreshold` - This is the amount of time, in milliseconds, that a frame must exceed to cause the DAT to log and output the frame's timing. For example to see what happens when a frame takes more that 33 ms to cook, put this parameter to 33.

### Logging Options

**Cook Time** `logcook` - Logs the cook time of operators.

**Export Time** `logexport` - Logs time spent exporting CHOP channels.

**Viewport Draw Time** `logviewport` - Logs time to draw 3D geometry and SOP viewers.

**Movie Time** `logmovie` - Logs time taken to read video and audio from movie files.

**Draw Channels Time** `logdrawchannels` - Logs time to draw channels in CHOP viewers.

**Object View Time** `logobjectview` - Logs time to draw objects in 3D viewers.

**Custom Panel Time** `logcustompanel` - Logs time taken by custom panels build with [CLASS_PanelCOMP]s.

**MIDI Time** `logmidi` - Logs time spent on MIDI.

**Graphics Time** `loggraphics` - Logs various graphics system calls, such as time spent waiting for the graphics card, calls to the graphic driver, converting TOP data to CHOPs, etc.

**Frame Length** `logframelength` - Logs total frame time in milliseconds (ms).

**Misc** `logmisc` - Logs miscellaneous times that do not fit into other categories.

**Script** `logscript` - Logs time spent running scripts.

**Render** `logrender` - Logs time spend by [CLASS_RenderTOP] or [CLASS_RenderPassTOP]s.

## Parameters - Common Page

**Language** `language` - Select how the DAT decides which script language to operate on.

**Edit/View Extension** `extension` - Select the file extension this DAT should expose to external editors.

**Custom Extension** `customext` - Specifiy the custom extension.

**Word Wrap** `wordwrap` - Enable Word Wrap for Node Display.

## Info CHOP Channels

Extra Information for the Perform DAT can be accessed via an [CLASS_InfoCHOP].

### Common DAT Info Channels

- `num_rows` - Number of rows in this DAT.
- `num_cols` - Number of columns in this DAT.

### Common Operator Info Channels

- `total_cooks` - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started.
- `cook_time` - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds.
- `cook_frame` - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline.
- `cook_abs_frame` - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time.
- `cook_start_time` - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked.
- `cook_end_time` - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked.
- `cooked_this_frame` - 1 if operator was cooked this frame.
- `warnings` - Number of warnings in this operator if any.
- `errors` - Number of errors in this operator if any.
