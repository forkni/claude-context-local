## Summary

Troubleshooting guide for debugging black screen issues in 3D rendering, covering common visibility, lighting, and camera problems.

## Relationship Justification

Strong connection to Render TOP and lighting concepts as core troubleshooting areas. Strong connection to lighting fundamentals as many black screen issues are lighting-related.

## Introduction

Often, your [CLASS_RenderTOP] is all black, though you expect to see something there. Here's are things to try to find out why you don't see what you expect.

## Basic Visibility Check

Check to see if anything is being rendered: Go to Edit -> [REF_Preferences] on the TOPs page, the Viewer Background is set to show Checker Board as the background (vs Black).

Then in your [CLASS_RenderTOP], if you see all-checkerboard, then there is indeed nothing rendering there. If it has black, there there is something rendering but isn't getting lit.

## Lighting Issues

If you see black instead of checkerboard, there's something rendering but it's not properly lit:

- Add a light, and make sure it is in front of the geometry.
- Change the material of the object to have Emit color, or Ambient color. Or change the Material to a Constant MAT with a default white color.
- For lights to have an effect, the display flag in the lights needs to be on.

## Camera and View Problems

Maybe the geometry is outside the field of view of the camera:

- Change the [CLASS_RenderTOP]'s Render Mode parameter to Cube Map. Here you see in all directions. If you see nothing in the Cube Map render...
- Check the Near and Far clipping planes of the camera. In your [CLASS_CameraCOMP], is your Near and Far parameter set to reasonable values that bound your 3D geometry? For large scenes with cameras at distances over 1000, your geometry may be outside the near/far clipping planes.
- You may want to replace the Camera that the [CLASS_RenderTOP] is using with a default [CLASS_CameraCOMP].

## Geometry Rendering Settings

Next it's time to check what's rendering:

- Check the Geometry parameter of the [CLASS_RenderTOP]. It should have a pattern to all your expected objects to render. To make sure you catch everything, put "*" into the Geometry parameter. If you still see nothing...
- Check that you are rendering Geometry components. On the Geometry components you expect to see, make sure their Render flag is on (purple).
- That's not enough. The Geometry components also have a Render parameter. Make sure the Render parameter is on.
- And that is not enough. For each [CLASS_GeometryCOMP], inside the component, make sure, for all the SOPs in your network that you expecting to render, that the Render flag is on at the bottom of the node.

## SOP-Level Troubleshooting

If you have done all that and you still see nothing, check the SOP that you expect to see:

- Middle mouse click to see the info on the SOP. Is the bounding box what you expect?
- Check to see if there is point or vertex color, in particular, make sure alpha is not set to 0. Or it's all black.
- One way to see the numbers in your SOP is to attach the SOP to a "[CLASS_SOPtoDAT]" operator and look at the different columns. Sometimes Normals that are 0 will give black results.
- If you still see nothing, put a [CLASS_SphereSOP] in your network and turn on its Render flag (and Display flag, so you can see it in a camera viewer).

## Material and Texture Issues

- Make sure Materials of your objects have a non-0 Alpha parameter setting.
- Make sure Materials that have texture maps contain textures with non-0 alpha. Replace your textures with white [CLASS_ConstantTOP]s.

## Component Hierarchy Issues

- Lights/cameras cannot be nested in [CLASS_BaseCOMP]s, as a base will exclude them from the Geometry Viewer.
- It might also be the case that the network path of the geometry viewer is not at a level from where all lights are visible.

## Advanced Troubleshooting

- Try creating a new empty [CLASS_RenderTOP], then adding in the objects / cameras that you expect to see. Try creating a default [CLASS_GeometryCOMP], default [CLASS_LightCOMP].

## Other Common Issues

Other things to check:

- Back-Face Culling settings
- Blend Modes on [CLASS_RenderTOP] (though unlikely)
