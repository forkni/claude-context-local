## Introduction

Multiple monitors are also known as: second monitor, multi-monitors, right monitor, dual monitors, multi-display.

TouchDesigner can send video out to multiple projectors, monitors and recorders. TouchDesigner can run single-monitor or across many monitors.

## Output to Multiple Monitors

Most modern graphics cards allow for at least 4 outputs. The easiest way to get more outputs is to use splitters such as QuadHead2Go or Datapath Fx4 monitor expansion devices.

Laptops all have different multi-monitor capabilities based on the manufacturer's specifications. Sometimes a laptop will have many output connections but still have limitations on the number of monitors it can drive simultaneously. Refer to the specifications for your specific laptop to understand its capabilities.

## Spanning Monitors for Best Performance

TouchDesigner will run fastest in [REF_PerformMode] if you combine all your panels into one canvas that spans across all your monitors. This can be done easily with [CLASS_ContainerCOMP]s, then by assigning this to the [CLASS_WindowCOMP] that is set for [REF_PerformMode] in the [REF_WindowPlacementDialog]. Using multiple [CLASS_WindowCOMP]s is not suggested, and will result in poor performance.

Example for two 1920x1080 monitors: `File:PerformMode Windows.toe`

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Windows

On the Desktop background, right-click -> Display Settings -> Multiple Displays -> Extend These Displays.

#### Combining Monitors into a Single Virtual Monitor

If possible, you should also join your monitors together into a single virtual monitor using Nvidia Mosaic, Nvidia Surround or AMD EyeFinity.

### macOS

System Preferences -> Displays -> Arrangement -> Mirror Displays = Off.

To allow monitor spanning on macOS, make sure the following is also set:

System Preferences -> Desktop & Dock -> Mission Control -> Displays have separate Spaces = Off

## Additional Setup Tips

- [REF_WindowPlacementDialog] can be used to quickly assign [REF_PerformMode] to different [CLASS_WindowCOMP]s, and adjust parameters, jump to the network, and open/close the windows.
- [REF_PerformMode] can be turned On and Off with the Shortcut keys F1 (On) and Esc (Off).
- The **Always on Top** parameter in the [CLASS_WindowCOMP] forces TouchDesigner to always be the top-most visible window.
