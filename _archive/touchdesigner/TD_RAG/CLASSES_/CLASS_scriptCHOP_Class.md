## Introduction

This class inherits from the [CLASS_CHOP] class. It references a specific [CLASS_ScriptCHOP].

## scriptCHOP Specific

### Members

#### timeSliceDefault

timeSliceDefault â†’ bool (Read Only):

Get the default Time Slice for the [CLASS_ScriptCHOP]. Equal to the first input's isTimeSlice.

### Methods

These methods can be used by including them in the onCook callback of the [CLASS_ScriptCHOP]. Using them outside the callback may cause unexpected results.

#### copyNumpyArray()

copyNumpyArray(numpyArray, baseName='chan')â†’ None:

Copies the contents of the numpyArray into the CHOP.

- `numpyArray` - The NumPy Array to copy. Must be shape(numChannels, numSamples). The data type must be float32.
- `baseName` - (Keyword, Optional) The base of all created channel names beginning with a suffix of 1. Example 'chan' creates 'chan1', 'chan2', etc.

#### destroyCustomPars()

destroyCustomPars()â†’ int:

Remove all custom parameters from the [CLASS_ScriptCHOP]. Returns number of destroyed pars.

#### sortCustomPages()

sortCustomPages(*pages)â†’ None:

Reorder custom parameter pages.

- `pages` - any number of page names in their new order

```python
scriptOp.sortPages('Definition','Controls')
```

#### clear()

clear()â†’ None:

Remove all channels from the CHOP. The channel length, sample rate etc. remain unchanged.

#### appendCustomPage()

appendCustomPage(name)â†’ [CLASS_Page]:

Add a new page of custom parameters. See [CLASS_Page] for more details.

```python
page = scriptOp.appendCustomPage('Custom1')
page.appendFloat('X1')
```

#### copy()

copy(chop)â†’ None:

Match all of this CHOPs channel data to the given CHOP. This includes sample rate, length, channel names and channel data.

- `chop` - The CHOP to copy. This should be a [CLASS_CHOP] instance, not a path to the CHOP.

#### appendChan()

appendChan(name)â†’ [CLASS_Channel]:

Append a new channel to the CHOP. If no name is given the channel will be given a default but unique name.

- `name` - (Optional) The name to give the channel.

```python
c = n.appendChan()
c = n.appendChan('velocity')
```

### Callbacks

The following python callbacks are associated with this operator.

```python
# me - this DAT
# scriptOp - the OP which is cooking

# press 'Setup Parameters' in the OP to call this function to re-create the parameters.
def onSetupParameters(scriptOp):
    page = scriptOp.appendCustomPage('Custom')
    p = page.appendFloat('Valuea', label='Value A')
    p = page.appendFloat('Valueb', label='Value B')
    return

# called whenever custom pulse parameter is pushed
def onPulse(par):
    return

def onCook(scriptOp):
    scriptOp.clear()
    return
```

**evalExpression(str)â†’ value**: Evaluate the expression from the context of this OP. Can be used to evaluate arbitrary snippets of code from arbitrary locations.

**destroy()â†’ None**: Destroy the operator referenced by this OP. An exception will be raised if the OP's operator has already been destroyed.

**var(name, search=True)â†’ str**: Evaluate avariable. This will return the empty string, if not found. Most information obtained from variables (except for Root and Component variables) are accessible through other means in Python, usually in the global td module.

**resetViewer(recurse=False)â†’ None**: Reset the OP content viewer to default view settings.

**openParameters()â†’ None**: Open a floating dialog containing the operator parameters.

#### Storage

Storage can be used to keep data within components. Storage is implemented as one python dictionary per node.

When an element of storage is changed by using n.store() as explained below, expressions and operators that depend on it will automatically re-cook. It is retrieved with the n.fetch() function.

Storage is saved in .toe and .tox files and restored on startup.

Storage can hold any python object type (not just strings as in Tscript variables). Storage elements can also have optional startup values, specified separately. Use these startup values for example, to avoid saving and loading some session specific object, and instead save or load a well defined object like None.

See the Examine DAT for procedurally viewing the contents of storage.

**fetch(key, default, search=True, storeDefault=False)â†’ value**: Return an object from the OP storage dictionary. If the item is not found, and a default it supplied, it will be returned instead.

**fetchOwner(key)â†’ OP**: Return the operator which contains the stored key, or None if not found.

**store(key, value)â†’ value**: Add the key/value pair to the OP's storage dictionary, or replace it if it already exists. If this value is not intended to be saved and loaded in the toe file, it can be be given an alternate value for saving and loading, by using the method storeStartupValue described below.

**unstore(keys1, keys2..)â†’ None**: For key, remove it from the OP's storage dictionary. Pattern Matching is supported as well.

**storeStartupValue(key, value)â†’ None**: Add the key/value pair to the OP's storage startup dictionary. The storage element will take on this value when the file starts up.

**unstoreStartupValue(keys1, keys2..)â†’ None**: For key, remove it from the OP's storage startup dictionary. Pattern Matching is supported as well. This does not affect the stored value, just its startup value.

#### Miscellaneous

****getstate**()â†’ dict**: Returns a dictionary with persistent data about the object suitable for pickling and deep copies.

****setstate**()â†’ dict**: Reads the dictionary to update persistent details about the object, suitable for unpickling and deep copies.
