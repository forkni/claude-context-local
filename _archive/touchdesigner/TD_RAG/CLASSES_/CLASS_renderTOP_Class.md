### Methods

No operator specific methods.

## TOP Class

### Members

#### width

width â†’ int (Read Only):

Texture width, measured in pixels.

#### height

height â†’ int (Read Only):

Texture height, measured in pixels.

#### aspect

aspect â†’ float (Read Only):

Texture aspect ratio, width divided by height.

#### aspectWidth

aspectWidth â†’ float (Read Only):

Texture aspect ratio, width.

#### aspectHeight

aspectHeight â†’ float (Read Only):

Texture aspect ratio, height.

#### depth

depth â†’ int (Read Only):

Texture depth, when using a 3 dimensional texture.

#### gpuMemory

gpuMemory â†’ int (Read Only):

The amount of GPU memory this TOP is using, in bytes.

#### curPass

curPass â†’ int (Read Only):

The current cooking pass iteration, beginning at 0. The total can be set with the 'Passes' parameter on the operator's common page.

#### isTOP

isTOP â†’ bool (Read Only):

True if the operators is a TOP.

#### newestSliceWOffset

newestSliceWOffset â†’ int (Read Only):

When a [CLASS_Texture3DTOP] fills it's contents, it keeps track of the newest slice it's filled so texturing can be offset this so a '0' coordinate results in the first slice. This member give you access to this value.

#### pixelFormat

pixelFormat â†’ str (Read Only):

Returns the pixel Format of the TOP. The returned string format resembles the pixel format on the operator's common page.

### Methods

#### sample()

sample(x=None,y=None,z=None,u=None,v=None,w=None)â†’ Tuple[float, float, float, float]:

Returns a 4-tuple representing the color value at the specified texture location. One horizontal and one vertical component must be specified. Note that this is a very expensive operation currently. It will always stall the graphics pipeline if the TOP is currently queued to get updated, and then downloads the entire texture (not just the requested pixel). Use this for debugging and non-realtime workflows only.

- `x` - (Keyword, Optional) The horizontal pixel coordinate to be sampled.
- `y` - (Keyword, Optional) The vertical pixel coordinate to be sampled.
- `z` - (Keyword, Optional) The depth pixel coordinate to be sampled. Available in builds 2022.23800 and later.
- `u` - (Keyword, Optional) The normalized horizontal coordinate to be sampled.
- `v` - (Keyword, Optional) The normalized vertical coordinate to be sampled.
- `w` - (Keyword, Optional) The normalized depth pixel coordinate to be sampled. Available in builds 2022.23800 and later.

```python
r = n.sample(x=25,y=100)[0]   #The red component at pixel 25,100.
g = n.sample(u=0.5,v=0.5)[1]  #The green component at the central location.
b = n.sample(x=25,v=0.5)[2]  #The blue 25 pixels across, and half way down.
```

#### numpyArray()

numpyArray(delayed=False, writable=False)â†’ numpy.ndarray:

Returns the TOP image as a Python NumPy array. Note that since NumPy arrays are referenced by line first, pixels are addressed as [h, w]. Currently data will always be in floating point, regardless of what the texture data format is on the GPU.

- `delayed` - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the download results will be delayed until the next call to numpyArray(), avoiding stalling the GPU waiting for the result immediately. This is useful to avoid long stalls that occur if immediately asking for the result. Each call with return the image that was 'current' on the previous call to numpyArray(). None will be returned if there isn't a result available. You should always check the return value against None to make sure you have a result. Call numpyArray() again, ideally on the next frame or later, to get the result. If you always need a result, you can call numpyArray() a second time in the event None is returned on the first call.
- `writable` - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the memory in the numpy array will be allocated in such a way that writes to it arn't slow. By default the memory the numpy array holds can be allocated in such a way that is very slow to write to. Note that in either case, writing to the numpy array will *not* change the data in the TOP.

#### save()

save(filepath, asynchronous=False, createFolders=False, quality=1.0, metadata=[])â†’ str:

Saves the image to the file system. Support file formats are: .tif, .tiff, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .png, .exr and .dds. Returns the filename and path used.

- `filepath` - (Optional) The path and filename to save to. If not given then a default filename will be used, and the file will be saved in the project.folder folder.
- `asynchronous` - (Keyword, Optional) If True, the save will occur in another thread. The file may not be done writing at the time this function returns.
- `createFolders` - (Keyword, Optional) If True, folders listed in the path that don't exist will be created.
- `quality` - (Keyword, Optional) Specify the compression quality used. Values range from 0 (lowest quality, small size) to 1 (best quality, largest size).
- `metadata` - (Keyword, Optional) A list of string pairs that will be inserted into the file's metadata section. Any type of list structure is supported (dictionary, tuple, etc) as long as each metadata item has two entries (key & value). Note: Only supported on EXR files.

```python
name = n.save()   #save in default format with default name.
n.save('picture.jpg')
n.save('image.exr', metadata=[ ("my_key", "my_value"), ("author_name", "derivative") ] ); # save as .exr with custom metadata
```

#### saveByteArray()

saveByteArray(filetype, quality=1.0, metadata=[])â†’ bytearray:

Saves the image to a bytearray object in the requested file format. Support file formats are: .tif, .tiff, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .png, .exr and .dds. Returns the bytearray object. To get the raw image data use numpyArray() or cudaArray() instead.

- `filetype` - (Optional) A string specifying the file type to save as. If not given the default file type '.tiff' will be used. Just the suffix of the string is used to determine the file type. E.g '.tiff', 'file.tiff', 'C:/Files/file.tiff' will all work. Suffix must include the period.
- `quality` - (Keyword, Optional) Specify the compression quality used. Values range from 0 (lowest quality, small size) to 1 (best quality, largest size).
- `metadata` - (Keyword, Optional) A list of string pairs that will be inserted into the file's metadata section. Any type of list structure is supported (dictionary, tuple, etc) as long as each metadata item has two entries (key & value). Note: Only supported on EXR files.

```python
arr = n.saveByteArray() # save in default format.
arr = n.saveByteArray('.jpg') # save as .jpg
arr = n.saveByteArray('.exr', metadata=[ ("my_key", "my_value"), ("author_name", "derivative") ] ); # save as .exr with custom metadata
```

#### cudaMemory()

cudaMemory(stream=None)â†’ [CLASS_CUDAMemory]:

Copies the contents of the TOP to a newly allocated block of raw CUDA memory. The CUDA memory will be deallocated when the returned [CLASS_CUDAMemory] object is deallocated. Ensure you keep a reference to the returned object around as long as you are using it.

- `stream` - (Optional) A CUDA stream handle to synchronize the operation with. Any CUDA subsequent operations occurring on this stream will wait for this CUDA memory to be filled before executing their operation. If this is left as None, then the default CUDA stream will be used (which results in poor performance).

**openParameters()â†’ None**: Open a floating dialog containing the operator parameters.

#### Storage

Storage can be used to keep data within components. Storage is implemented as one python dictionary per node.

When an element of storage is changed by using n.store() as explained below, expressions and operators that depend on it will automatically re-cook. It is retrieved with the n.fetch() function.

Storage is saved in .toe and .tox files and restored on startup.

Storage can hold any python object type (not just strings as in Tscript variables). Storage elements can also have optional startup values, specified separately. Use these startup values for example, to avoid saving and loading some session specific object, and instead save or load a well defined object like None.

See the Examine DAT for procedurally viewing the contents of storage.

**fetch(key, default, search=True, storeDefault=False)â†’ value**: Return an object from the OP storage dictionary. If the item is not found, and a default it supplied, it will be returned instead.

**fetchOwner(key)â†’ OP**: Return the operator which contains the stored key, or None if not found.

**store(key, value)â†’ value**: Add the key/value pair to the OP's storage dictionary, or replace it if it already exists. If this value is not intended to be saved and loaded in the toe file, it can be be given an alternate value for saving and loading, by using the method storeStartupValue described below.

**unstore(keys1, keys2..)â†’ None**: For key, remove it from the OP's storage dictionary. Pattern Matching is supported as well.

**storeStartupValue(key, value)â†’ None**: Add the key/value pair to the OP's storage startup dictionary. The storage element will take on this value when the file starts up.

**unstoreStartupValue(keys1, keys2..)â†’ None**: For key, remove it from the OP's storage startup dictionary. Pattern Matching is supported as well. This does not affect the stored value, just its startup value.

#### Miscellaneous

****getstate**()â†’ dict**: Returns a dictionary with persistent data about the object suitable for pickling and deep copies.

****setstate**()â†’ dict**: Reads the dictionary to update persistent details about the object, suitable for unpickling and deep copies.
