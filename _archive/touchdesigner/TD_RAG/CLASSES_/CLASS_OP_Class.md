## Members

### General

valid â†’ bool (Read Only):

True if the referenced operator currently exists, False if it has been deleted.

id â†’ int (Read Only):

Unique id for the operator. This id can also be passed to the op() and ops() methods. Id's are not consistent when a file is re-opened, and will change if the OP is copied/pasted, changes OP types, deleted/undone. The id will not change if the OP is renamed though. Its data type is integer.

name â†’ str :

Get or set the operator name.

path â†’ str (Read Only):

Full path to the operator.

digits â†’ int (Read Only):

Returns the numeric value of the last consecutive group of digits in the name, or None if not found. The digits can be in the middle of the name if there are none at the end of the name.

base â†’ str (Read Only):

Returns the beginning portion of the name occurring before any digits.

passive â†’ bool (Read Only):

If true, operator will not cook before its access methods are called. To use a passive version of an operator n, use passive(n).

Storage is dictionary associated with this operator. Values stored in this dictionary are persistent, and saved with the operator. The dictionary attribute is read only, but not its contents. Its contents may be manipulated directly with methods such as OP.fetch() or OP.store() described below, or examined with an Examine DAT.

tags â†’ list :

Get or set a set of user defined strings. Tags can be searched using OP.findChildren() and the OP Find DAT.

The set is a regular python set, and can be accessed accordingly:

n.tags = ['effect', 'image filter']
n.tags.add('darken')
children â†’ list (Read Only):

A list of operators contained within this operator. Only component operators have children, otherwise an empty list is returned.

numChildren â†’ int (Read Only):

op(pattern1, pattern2..., includeUtility=False) â†’ OP or None

Returns the first OP whose path matches the given pattern, relative to the inside of this operator. Will return None if nothing is found. Multiple patterns may be specified which are all added to the search. Numeric OP ids may also be used.

pattern - Can be string following the Pattern Matching rules, specifying which OP to return, or an integer, which must be an OP Id. Multiple patterns can be given, the first matching OP will be returned.
includeUtility (Optional) - if True, allow Utility nodes to be returned. If False, Utility nodes will be ignored.
b = op('project1')
b = op('foot*', 'hand*') #comma separated
b = op('foot*hand*')  #space separated

That is, cutting and pasting an operator with a Global OP Shortcut specified will lead to a name conflict. One shortcut must be renamed in that case. Furthermore, only components can be given Global OP Shortcuts.
shortcut - Corresponds to the Global OP Shortcut parameter specified in the target operator.
b = op.Videoplayer
To list all Global OP Shortcuts:

for x in op:
 print(x)
opex â†’ OP (Read Only):

An operator finder object, for accessing operators through paths or shortcuts. Works like the op() shortcut method, except it will raise an exception if it fails to find the node instead of returning None as op() does. This is now the recommended way to get nodes in parameter expressions, as the error will be more useful than, for example, NoneType has no attribute "par", that is often seen when using op(). Note: a version of this method that searches relative to '/' is also in the global td module.

op(pattern1, pattern2..., includeUtility=False) â†’ OP

Returns the first OP whose path matches the given pattern, relative to the inside of this operator. Will return None if nothing is found. Multiple patterns may be specified which are all added to the search. Numeric OP ids may also be used.

pattern - Can be string following the Pattern Matching rules, specifying which OP to return, or an integer, which must be an OP Id. Multiple patterns can be given, the first matching OP will be returned.
includeUtility (Optional) - if True, allow Utility nodes to be returned. If False, Utility operators will be ignored.
parent â†’ Shortcut (Read Only):

The Parent Shortcut object, for accessing parent components through indices or shortcuts.

Note: a version of this method that searches relative to the current operator is also in the global td module.

parent(n) â†’ OP or None

The nth parent of this operator. If n not specified, returns the parent. If n = 2, returns the parent of the parent, etc. If no parent exists at that level, None is returned.

n - (Optional) n is the number of levels up to climb. When n = 1 it will return the operator's parent.
p = parent(2) #grandfather
parent.shortcut â†’ OP

A parent component specified with a shortcut. If no parent exists an exception is raised.

shortcut - Corresponds to the Parent Shortcut parameter specified in the target parent.

includeUtility - (Keyword, Optional) If specified, controls whether or not utility components (eg Comments) are included in the results.
copyParameters(OP, custom=True, builtin=True)â†’ None:

Copy all of the parameters from the specified operator. Both operators should be the same type.

OP - The operator to copy.

op('/').resetViewer(recurse=True) # reset the viewer for all operators in the entire file.
openParameters()â†’ None:

Open a floating dialog containing the operator parameters.

#### Storage

Storage can be used to keep data within components. Storage is implemented as one python dictionary per node.

When an element of storage is changed by using n.store() as explained below, expressions and operators that depend on it will automatically re-cook. It is retrieved with the n.fetch() function.

Storage is saved in .toe and .tox files and restored on startup.

Storage can hold any python object type (not just strings as in Tscript variables). Storage elements can also have optional startup values, specified separately. Use these startup values for example, to avoid saving and loading some session specific object, and instead save or load a well defined object like None.

See the Examine DAT for procedurally viewing the contents of storage.

fetch(key, default, search=True, storeDefault=False)â†’ value:

Return an object from the OP storage dictionary. If the item is not found, and a default it supplied, it will be returned instead.

key - The name of the entry to retrieve.
default - (Optional) If provided and no item is found then the passed value/object is returned instead.
storeDefault - (Keyword, Optional) If True, and the key is not found, the default is stored as well.
search - (Keyword, Optional) If True, the parent of each OP is searched recursively until a match is found
v = n.fetch('sales5', 0.0)
fetchOwner(key)â†’ OP:

Return the operator which contains the stored key, or None if not found.

key - The key to the stored entry you are looking for.
who = n.fetchOwner('sales5') #find the OP that has a storage entry called 'sales5'
store(key, value)â†’ value:

Add the key/value pair to the OP's storage dictionary, or replace it if it already exists. If this value is not intended to be saved and loaded in the toe file, it can be be given an alternate value for saving and loading, by using the method storeStartupValue described below.

key - A string name for the storage entry. Use this name to retrieve the value using fetch().
value - The value/object to store.
n.store('sales5', 34.5) # stores a floating point value 34.5.
n.store('moviebank', op('/project1/movies')) # stores an OP for easy access later on.
