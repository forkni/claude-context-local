## Members

No operator specific members.

## Methods

These methods can be used by including them in the onCook callback of the Script TOP. Using them outside the callback may cause unexpected results.

copyNumpyArray(numpyArray)→ None:

Copies the contents of the numpyArary into the TOPs texture.

numpyArray - The NumPy Array to copy. Must be shape(h, w, numComponents), where numComponents is 1, 2, 3, or 4. The data type must be uint8, uint16 or float32.
copyCUDAMemory(address, size, shape, stream=None)→ None:

Copies the contents of the ptr, with given size and shape (CUDAMemoryShape) into the TOPs texture. If you obtained your data from cudaMemory(), these pieces of data are available in the CUDAMemory that cudaMemory() returns.

address - The source CUDA memory address.
size - The size of the CUDA memory.
shape - A CUDAMemoryShape object describing the shape of the texture to create. See the help for that class for notes about the channel order requirements for different data types.
stream - (Optional) A CUDA Stream handle that the copy operation will use to synchronize the copy. It will ensure all current operations on that stream have completed before the copy occurs.
loadByteArray(extension, byteArray)→ bool:

Load the compressed file stored in byteArray into the Script TOP. See .saveByteArray() for all TOPs which creates byte arrays of images in the same format.

fileType - The file extension of the type of file being loaded. E.g '.jpg', '.tiff', 'filename.jpg'. Must include the period, can contain data before the period as well, which is ignored.
byteArray - The bytearray (or bytes) object containing the file data to load.
appendCustomPage(name)→ Page:

Add a new page of custom parameters. See Page Class for more details.

page = scriptOp.appendCustomPage('Custom1')
page.appendFloat('X1')
destroyCustomPars()→ int:

Remove all custom parameters from the Script TOP. Returns number of destroyed pars.

sortCustomPages(*pages)→ None:

Reorder custom parameter pages.

pages - any number of page names in their new order
scriptOp.sortPages('Definition','Controls')

## TOP Class

### Members

width → int (Read Only):

Texture width, measured in pixels.

height → int (Read Only):

Texture height, measured in pixels.

aspect → float (Read Only):

Texture aspect ratio, width divided by height.

aspectWidth → float (Read Only):

Texture aspect ratio, width.

aspectHeight → float (Read Only):

Texture aspect ratio, height.

depth → int (Read Only):

Texture depth, when using a 3 dimensional texture.

gpuMemory → int (Read Only):

The amount of GPU memory this TOP is using, in bytes.

curPass → int (Read Only):

The current cooking pass iteration, beginning at 0. The total can be set with the 'Passes' parameter on the operator's common page.

isTOP → bool (Read Only):

True if the operators is a TOP.

newestSliceWOffset → int (Read Only):

When a Texture3D TOP fills it's contents, it keeps track of the newest slice it's filled so texturing can be offset this so a '0' coordinate results in the first slice. This member give you access to this value.

pixelFormat → str (Read Only):

Returns the pixel Format of the TOP. The returned string format resembles the pixel format on the operator's common page.

### Methods

sample(x=None,y=None,z=None,u=None,v=None,w=None)→ Tuple[float, float, float, float]:

Returns a 4-tuple representing the color value at the specified texture location. One horizontal and one vertical component must be specified. Note that this is a very expensive operation currently. It will always stall the graphics pipeline if the TOP is currently queued to get updated, and then downloads the entire texture (not just the requested pixel). Use this for debugging and non-realtime workflows only.

x - (Keyword, Optional) The horizontal pixel coordinate to be sampled.
y - (Keyword, Optional) The vertical pixel coordinate to be sampled.
z - (Keyword, Optional) The depth pixel coordinate to be sampled. Available in builds 2022.23800 and later.
u - (Keyword, Optional) The normalized horizontal coordinate to be sampled.
v - (Keyword, Optional) The normalized vertical coordinate to be sampled.
w - (Keyword, Optional) The normalized depth pixel coordinate to be sampled. Available in builds 2022.23800 and later.
r = n.sample[x=25,y=100](0)   #The red component at pixel 25,100.
g = n.sample[u=0.5,v=0.5](1)  #The green component at the central location.
b = n.sample[x=25,v=0.5](2)  #The blue 25 pixels across, and half way down.
numpyArray(delayed=False, writable=False)→ numpy.ndarray:

Returns the TOP image as a Python NumPy array. Note that since NumPy arrays are referenced by line first, pixels are addressed as [h, w]. Currently data will always be in floating point, regardless of what the texture data format is on the GPU.

delayed - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the download results will be delayed until the next call to numpyArray(), avoiding stalling the GPU waiting for the result immediately. This is useful to avoid long stalls that occur if immediately asking for the result. Each call with return the image that was 'current' on the previous call to numpyArray(). None will be returned if there isn't a result available. You should always check the return value against None to make sure you have a result. Call numpyArray() again, ideally on the next frame or later, to get the result. If you always need a result, you can call numpyArray() a second time in the event None is returned on the first call.
writable - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the memory in the numpy array will be allocated in such a way that writes to it arn't slow. By default the memory the numpy array holds can be allocated in such a way that is very slow to write to. Note that in either case, writing to the numpy array will *not* change the data in the TOP.
save(filepath, asynchronous=False, createFolders=False, quality=1.0, metadata=[])→ str:

Saves the image to the file system. Support file formats are: .tif, .tiff, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .png, .exr and .dds. Returns the filename and path used.

filepath - (Optional) The path and filename to save to. If not given then a default filename will be used, and the file will be saved in the project.folder folder.
aysnchronous - (Keyword, Optional) If True, the save will occur in another thread. The file may not be done writing at the time this function returns.
createFolders - (Keyword, Optional) If True, folders listed in the path that don't exist will be created.
quality - (Keyword, Optional) Specify the compression quality used. Values range from 0 (lowest quality, small size) to 1 (best quality, largest size).
metadata - (Keyword, Optional) A list of string pairs that will be inserted into the file's metadata section. Any type of list structure is supported (dictionary, tuple, etc) as long as each metadata item has two entries (key & value). Note: Only supported on EXR files.
name = n.save()   #save in default format with default name.
n.save('picture.jpg')
n.save('image.exr', metadata=[ ("my_key", "my_value"), ("author_name", "derivative") ] ); # save as .exr with custom metadata
saveByteArray(filetype, quality=1.0, metadata=[])→ bytearray:

Saves the image to a bytearray object in the requested file format. Support file formats are: .tif, .tiff, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .png, .exr and .dds. Returns the bytearray object. To get the raw image data use numpyArray() or cudaArray() instead.

filetype - (Optional) A string specifying the file type to save as. If not given the default file type '.tiff' will be used. Just the suffix of the string is used to determine the file type. E.g '.tiff', 'file.tiff', 'C:/Files/file.tiff' will all work. Suffix must include the period.
quality - (Keyword, Optional) Specify the compression quality used. Values range from 0 (lowest quality, small size) to 1 (best quality, largest size).
metadata - (Keyword, Optional) A list of string pairs that will be inserted into the file's metadata section. Any type of list structure is supported (dictionary, tuple, etc) as long as each metadata item has two entries (key & value). Note: Only supported on EXR files.
arr = n.saveByteArray() # save in default format.
arr = n.saveByteArray('.jpg') # save as .jpg
arr = n.saveByteArray('.exr', metadata=[ ("my_key", "my_value"), ("author_name", "derivative") ] ); # save as .exr with custom metadata
cudaMemory(stream=None)→ CUDAMemory:

Copies the contents of the TOP to a newly allocated block of raw CUDA memory. The CUDA memory will be deallocated when the returned CUDAMemory object is deallocated. Ensure you keep a reference to the returned object around as long as you are using it.

stream - (Optional) A CUDA stream handle to synchronize the operation with. Any CUDA subsequent operations occurring on this stream will wait for this CUDA memory to be filled before executing their operation. If this is left as None, then the default CUDA stream will be used (which results in poor performance).

## OP Class

### Members

tags → list :

Get or set a set of user defined strings. Tags can be searched using OP.findChildren() and the OP Find DAT.

Furthermore, only components can be given Global OP Shortcuts.
shortcut - Corresponds to the Global OP Shortcut parameter specified in the target operator.
b = op.Videoplayer
To list all Global OP Shortcuts:

for x in op:
 print(x)
opex → OP (Read Only):

Works like the op() shortcut method, except it will raise an exception if it fails to find the node instead of returning None as op() does. This is now the recommended way to get nodes in parameter expressions, as the error will be more useful than, for example, NoneType has no attribute "par", that is often seen when using op(). Note: a version of this method that searches relative to '/' is also in the global td module.

op(pattern1, pattern2..., includeUtility=False) → OP

## Methods

### General

NOTE: create(), copy() and copyOPs() is done by the parent operator (a component). For more information see COMP.create, COMP.copy and COMP.copyOPs methods.

pars(pattern)→ list:

Returns a (possibly empty) list of parameter objects that match the pattern.

pattern - Is a string following the Pattern Matching rules, specifying which parameters to return.
newlist = op('geo1').pars('t?', 'r?', 's?') #translate/rotate/scale parameters
Note: If searching for a single parameter given a name, it's much more efficient to use the subscript operator. For example:

name = 'MyName1'
op('geo1').par[name]
cook(force=False, recurse=False, includeUtility=False)→ None:

Cook the contents of the operator if required.

force - (Keyword, Optional) If True, the operator will always cook, even if it wouldn't under normal circumstances.
recurse - (Keyword, Optional) If True, all children and sub-children of the operator will be cooked.
includeUtility - (Keyword, Optional) If specified, controls whether or not utility components (eg Comments) are included in the results.
copyParameters(OP, custom=True, builtin=True)→ None:

Copy all of the parameters from the specified operator. Both operators should be the same type.

OP - The operator to copy.
custom - (Keyword, Optional) When True, custom parameters will be copied.
builtin - (Keyword, Optional) When True, built in parameters will be copied.
op('geo1').copyParameters( op('geo2') )
changeType(OPtype)→ OP:

Change referenced operator to a new operator type. After this call, this OP object should no longer be referenced. Instead use the returned OP object.

OPtype - The python class name of the operator type you want to change this operator to. This is not a string, but instead is a class defined in the global td module.

### Storage

Storage can be used to keep data within components. Storage is implemented as one python dictionary per node.

When an element of storage is changed by using n.store() as explained below, expressions and operators that depend on it will automatically re-cook. It is retrieved with the n.fetch() function.

Storage is saved in .toe and .tox files and restored on startup.

Storage can hold any python object type (not just strings as in Tscript variables). Storage elements can also have optional startup values, specified separately. Use these startup values for example, to avoid saving and loading some session specific object, and instead save or load a well defined object like None.

See the Examine DAT for procedurally viewing the contents of storage.

fetch(key, default, search=True, storeDefault=False)→ value:

Return an object from the OP storage dictionary. If the item is not found, and a default it supplied, it will be returned instead.

key - The name of the entry to retrieve.
default - (Optional) If provided and no item is found then the passed value/object is returned instead.
storeDefault - (Keyword, Optional) If True, and the key is not found, the default is stored as well.
search - (Keyword, Optional) If True, the parent of each OP is searched recursively until a match is found
v = n.fetch('sales5', 0.0)
fetchOwner(key)→ OP:

Return the operator which contains the stored key, or None if not found.

key - The key to the stored entry you are looking for.
who = n.fetchOwner('sales5') #find the OP that has a storage entry called 'sales5'
store(key, value)→ value:

Add the key/value pair to the OP's storage dictionary, or replace it if it already exists. If this value is not intended to be saved and loaded in the toe file, it can be be given an alternate value for saving and loading, by using the method storeStartupValue described below.

key - A string name for the storage entry. Use this name to retrieve the value using fetch().
value - The value/object to store.
n.store('sales5', 34.5) # stores a floating point value 34.5.
n.store('moviebank', op('/project1/movies')) # stores an OP for easy access later on.
unstore(keys1, keys2..)→ None:

For key, remove it from the OP's storage dictionary. Pattern Matching is supported as well.

keys - The name or pattern defining which key/value pairs to remove from the storage dictionary.
n.unstore('sales*') # removes all entries from this OPs storage that start with 'sales'
storeStartupValue(key, value)→ None:

Add the key/value pair to the OP's storage startup dictionary. The storage element will take on this value when the file starts up.

key - A string name for the storage startup entry.
value - The startup value/object to store.
n.storeStartupValue('sales5', 1) # 'sales5' will have a value of 1 when the file starts up.
unstoreStartupValue(keys1, keys2..)→ None:

For key, remove it from the OP's storage startup dictionary. Pattern Matching is supported as well. This does not affect the stored value, just its startup value.

keys - The name or pattern defining which key/value pairs to remove from the storage startup dictionary.
n.unstoreStartupValue('sales*') # removes all entries from this OPs storage startup that start with 'sales'

### Miscellaneous

**getstate**()→ dict:

Returns a dictionary with persistent data about the object suitable for pickling and deep copies.

**setstate**()→ dict:

Reads the dictionary to update persistent details about the object, suitable for unpickling and deep copies.
