## Introduction

The Network Editor is a pane type in TouchDesigner that is used to create and modify Operators. The Network Editor is the default pane type for TouchDesigner and is visible when the program is launched. Navigating in the Network Editor is an important skill to learn early in TouchDesigner. Mastery of the Network Editor allows you to more easily modify and update your networks over time. The primary tool for network navigation is the mouse, although some operations have menu or keyboard equivalents. Each mouse button manipulates the Network Editor interface in a different way.

## Network Navigation

### Node Selection

Use the left mouse button `LMB` to select nodes. To box-select multiple nodes hold `Shift` while dragging with `LMB` or use the `RMB`. Alternatively, you can hold down the `Ctrl` key and left-click on each individual node you want to add to the selection. To move a node, select it and keep the `LMB` depressed to drag it around the Network Editor.

### Moving Around the Network

The left mouse button (`LMB`) navigates networks without changing the zoom level. Drag using the `LMB` in any empty area in the network to pan around the network. A scale 'overview' representation of the Network can be toggled on and off with the `o` key.

### Zooming

The middle mouse button `MMB` controls the zoom level, hold `MMB` and drag right or left to zoom in or out. To return to Unity Zoom (zoom level of 1), use the keyboard shortcut `f` for Unity Frame All.

If the middle mouse button is also a scroll wheel on your mouse, scroll forwards to zoom in and scroll backwards to zoom out.

You can also box zoom by holding down the `Ctrl` button while using the `MMB`. To zoom in, hold down `Ctrl` and draw a box from left to right with the `MMB`. To zoom out, draw the box from right to left.

### Moving Between Networks

There are several ways to move in and out of Component networks.

- **To enter a network (go inside a component):**
  - double-click on a component to go inside its network
  - use the scroll wheel to zoom up close to a component and keep zooming in to go inside its network
  - select the component and then press `<Enter>` key to go inside its network
  - select the component and then press the `<i>` key to go inside its network
  - select the component and then press the 'double arrow' in the network path found at the top of the pane
  - on the component click `RMB` and select `Enter Component` from the menu

- **When inside a Component, to go up a level:**
  - press the `u` key
  - use the scroll wheel to zoom out
  - in the network path found at the top of the pane, click on the componentâ€™s name you want to see. For example, if the path is `/project1/scene1/geo2` and you want to go `/project1`, simply click on the word "project1".
  - you may find the `Back` and `Forward` buttons in the top pane bar handy to navigate in and out of Components.

## Interacting with Operators

Here are some other interactions you can perform in the Network Editor.

- Resize nodes by grabbing the edge of the node with `LMB` and dragging
- Grid snapping is on by default, adjust grid options in `Preferences` (`Edit -> Preferences -> Network`)
- Layout and Display options are found in the Network Editor's `RMB` menu
- Node Viewers can go into `Viewer Active` mode (interactive mode) by clicking on the `Viewer Active` flag found in the lower-right corner.
- Middle-clicking on node will open the operator info popup.
- Flags on the operators can be used to toggle their state (display state, render state, pickable state, etc)
- `Animated Wires` indicate data flow between operators.
- The Network Editor can be toggled to list mode by pressing the `shift+t` keyboard shortcut or by selecting if from the right-click menu.
