## Introduction

In Designer Mode, you edit your `Network`, `Nodes` and `Parameters` in the `Network Editor`, `Animation Editor` and other `Panes`.

In contrast, [TD_Perform_Mode] is the user interface you create in Designer Mode.

Designer Mode has its `Application Shortcuts`, distinct from those of Perform Mode.
