## Parameters

| Parameter | Label | Type | Description |
|-----------|-------|------|-------------|
| `active` | Active | Toggle | Control if this node is outputting data to the OpenVR driver. |
| `outputresolution` | Output Resolution | Menu | quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data. |
| `resolution` | Resolution | Int | Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu ... |
| `resmenu` | Resolution Menu | Pulse | A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions. |
| `resmult` | Use Global Res Multiplier | Toggle | Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware spe... |
| `outputaspect` | Output Aspect | Menu | Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square p... |
| `aspect` | Aspect | Float | Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect. |

| `filtertype` | Viewer Smoothness | Menu | This controls pixel filtering in the viewers. |
| `npasses` | Passes | Int | Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the ... |
| `chanmask` | Channel Mask | Menu | Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the TOP will operate on. All channels are selected by default. |
| `format` | Pixel Format | Menu | Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information. |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
# Access the TOP openvrTOP operator
openvrtop_op = op('openvrtop1')

# Get/set parameters
freq_value = openvrtop_op.par.active.eval()
openvrtop_op.par.active = 1
```

### In Networks

```python
# Connect operators
input_op = op('source1')
openvrtop_op = op('openvrtop1')
output_op = op('output1')

openvrtop_op.inputConnectors[0].connect(input_op)
output_op.inputConnectors[0].connect(openvrtop_op)
```
