# COMP bulletsolverCOMP

## Overview

In a Bullet Dynamics system, the Bullet Solver COMP is analogous to the world/simulation in which actors/bodies (ie. Actor COMPs) operate.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Label | Type | Description |
|-----------|-------|------|-------------|
| `actors` | Actors | objref | The Actor COMPs to include in the simulation. These actors cannot already be a part of another Bullet Solver COMP. |
| `forces` | Global Forces | objref | The Force COMPs to include in the simulation. These forces are global forces and will be applied to all non-static actors in the simulation. |
| `gravity` | Gravitational Acceleration | float | Gravity applied to all actors in the simulation in m/s^2. Gravity is applied to actors irrespective of their mass. |
| `dimension` | Dimension | dropmenu | The dimension of the simulation. The options in this menu can also be recreated using the linear/angular multiplier parameters. |
| `linmult` | Linear Multiplier | float | A multiplier for the linear velocities of the actors in the simulation. For example, if linmult is (0, 1, 1) then the actors can move linearly at normal speed on the Y and Z axes but cannot move in... |
| `angmult` | Angular Multiplier | float | A multiplier for the angular velocities of the actors in the simulation. For example, if angmult is (1, 0, 0) then the actors can only rotate on the X axes. These values are multiplied internally b... |
| `initall` | Initialize Sim and Collision Shapes | button | Resets all bodies to their initial state (ie. position, orientation, velocity) and recreates their collision shapes. This parameter is equivalent to pulsing each Actor COMP's "Initialize Actor". Cr... |
| `init` | Initialize Sim | button | Reset all bodies to their initial state (ie. position, orientation, velocity). This will not begin stepping through the simulation, it will only initialize. NOTE: This will not reset the collision ... |
| `start` | Start Sim | button | Initialize the simulation and run it (begin stepping). |
| `play` | Play | toggle | Play the simulation. Will step through the simulation when toggled on, but will not when it is toggled off (ie. it will be paused). |
| `rate` | Sample Rate | float | The sample rate of the simulation.  The sample rate affects the timestep, which is 1/rate |
| `simspeed` | Simulation Speed | float | The speed of the simulation. It is a multiplier for the size of the timestep to slow down or speed up the simulation. |
