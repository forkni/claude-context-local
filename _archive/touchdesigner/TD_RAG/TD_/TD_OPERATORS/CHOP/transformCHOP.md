# CHOP transformCHOP

## Overview

The Transform CHOP takes transformations in various formats, applied operations to them, and outputs them in various formats.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Label | Type | Description |
|-----------|-------|------|-------------|
| `custinputorders` | Custom Input Orders | Toggle | This allows the input order, if provided, to be ignored and overridden by a custom order chosen by the following two parameters. |
| `inxord` | Transform Order | Menu | Changing the Transform order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block. In matrix math t... |
| `inrord` | Rotate Order | Menu | As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the rotations take place will alter the final position and orientation. A Rotation order of Rx Ry Rz would create the final rotation mat... |
| `input0preop` | Input 0 Pre Operation | Menu | Operation(s) to apply on the transforms on Input 0, before they are combined with other transforms. |
| `input1preop` | Input 1 Pre Operation | Menu | Operation(s) to apply on the transforms on Input 1, before they are combined with other transforms. |
| `inputoperation` | Input Operation | Menu | The operation that should be applied between transforms coming from Input 0 and Input 1. Refer to the main description of this node for an explanation of how multiple samples and/or transform sets ... |
| `inputweight` | Input Weight | Float | Specify the Blend weight for the above 'Input Operation' |
| `xord` | Transform Order | Menu | See description from earlier Transform Order parameter. |
| `rord` | Rotate Order | Menu | See description from earlier Rotate Order parameter. |
| `t` | Translate | XYZ | XYZ translation values. |
| `r` | Rotate | XYZ | XYZ rotation, in degrees. |
| `s` | Scale | XYZ | XYZ scale to shrink or enlarge the transform. |
| `p` | Pivot | XYZ | XYZ pivot to apply the above operations around. |
| `xformmatrixop` | Xform Matrix/CHOP/DAT | CHOP |  |
| `multiplyorder` | Multiply Order | Menu | Controls how the input transform(s) are combined with the transform specified on this page. The below two descriptions use a multiply "vector on the right" convention (column vectors). |
| `lookat` | Look At | Object | Allows you to generate your transform channels by specifying an object you would like to Look At, or point to. The generated transform channels will be such that when you transform an object using ... |
| `upvector` | Up Vector | XYZ | When orienting an object, the Up Vector is used to determine where the positive Y axis points. |
| `forwarddir` | Forward Direction | Menu | Sets which axis and direction is considered the forward direction. |
| `preop` | Pre Operation | Menu | Operation(s) to apply on the transform generated by Transform/Rotate/Scale/Pivot parameters, before it is combined with other transforms. Done before combining with the Xform Matrix and Look At. |
| `operation` | Operation | Menu | Controls how the input transform(s) are combined with the transform specified on this page. The below two descriptions use a multiply "vector on the right" convention (column vectors). |
| `weight` | Weight | Float | Specify the Blend weight for the above 'Operation' |
| `postop` | Post Operation | Menu | Optionally applied one last operation to the final generated transform before it is output. |
| `output` | Output | Menu | Specify the format the transform will be output in. |
| `determ` | Determinant | Toggle | When outputting a matrix, it's determinant can also be output by enabling this parameter. |
| `unmatchedchans` | Un-matched Channels | Menu | Controls how channels that don't match the naming convention for the various transform format are treated. |
| `custoutputorders` | Custom Output Orders | Toggle | By default the output transforms will use the orders given on teh Transform page. Enabling this allows for custom orders to be used for the transform that is output. This doesn't change the transfo... |
| `outxord` | Transform Order | Menu | See description from earlier Transform Order parameter. |
| `outrord` | Rotate Order | Menu | See description from earlier Rotate Order parameter. |
| `includeorderchans` | Include Order Channels | Toggle | Specified if the 'xord' and 'rord' channels should be output from this node. 'xord' will be output for 'Transform (Euler)' and 'Transform (Quaternion)' modes. 'rord' will be output for the 'Transfo... |
| `continuousrotations` | Continuous Rotations | Toggle | In the case the input has multiple samples, this will attempt to keep rotations of neighbouring samples continuous. Basically, it tries to avoid 360 degree jumps. 360-> 361 instead of 360 -> 1 (whi... |
| `usehint` | Use Rotation Hint | Toggle | An initial rotation hint given in r[xyz] degrees to try to stay continuous against. Turning this on and using the Hint parameter below allows you to specify approximate starting values for the rota... |
| `hint` | Hint | XYZ | Specify approximate starting values for the rotation channels produced. |
| `timeslice` | Time Slice | Toggle | Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced".  A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame. |
| `scope` | Scope | StrMenu | To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See :Pattern Matching. |
| `srselect` | Sample Rate Match | Menu | Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate... |
| `exportmethod` | Export Method | Menu | This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information. |
| `autoexportroot` | Export Root | OP | This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to. |
| `exporttable` | Export Table | DAT | The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above). |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
# Access the CHOP transformCHOP operator
transformchop_op = op('transformchop1')

# Get/set parameters
freq_value = transformchop_op.par.active.eval()
transformchop_op.par.active = 1
```

### In Networks

```python
# Connect operators
input_op = op('source1')
transformchop_op = op('transformchop1')
output_op = op('output1')

transformchop_op.inputConnectors[0].connect(input_op)
output_op.inputConnectors[0].connect(transformchop_op)
```
