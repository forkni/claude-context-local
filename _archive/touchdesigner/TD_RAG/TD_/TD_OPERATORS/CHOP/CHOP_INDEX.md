**Description**: Creates vibrations influenced by the input channels, as if a mass was attached to a spring. It acts as if, for every channel, there is a mass at the end of a spring, affected by a distance from the actual position (the output of the channel at the previous frame) to the desired position (the input channel at the current frame).
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Spring.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Stretch

**Category**: General
**Description**: Preserves the shape of channels and the sampling rate, but resamples the channels into a new interval.
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Stretch.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Switch

**Category**: General
**Description**: Allows you to control the flow of channels through a CHOPnet. It selects one of the input CHOPs by index and copies it exactly.
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Switch.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Sync In

**Category**: General
**Description**: And Sync Out CHOP are used to keep timelines in two or more TouchDesigner processes within a single frame of each other.
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Sync_In.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Sync Out

**Category**: General
**Description**: The Sync In CHOP and Sync Out CHOP are used to keep timelines in two or more TouchDesigner processes within a single frame of each other.
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Sync_Out.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### TOP to

**Category**: General
**Description**: Converts pixels in a TOP image to CHOP channels. It generates one CHOP channel per scanline (row) in the image and per pixel color element (RGBA).
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./TOP_to.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Tablet

**Category**: General
**Description**: Gets the Wacom tablet X and Y values, and also gets pen tip pressure, X tilt and Y tilt, and the various pen buttons.
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Tablet.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Time Slice

**Category**: General
**Description**: Outputs a time slice of samples. It is used to generate smooth in-betweens when TouchDesigner cannot cook/draw fast enough and keep up with the animation's frames per second.
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Time_Slice.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Timeline

**Category**: General
**Description**: Outputs time-based CHOP channels for a specific component.  The time channels are defined by a Time Component whose Path can be determined using the expression timepath() .
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Timeline.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Timer

**Category**: General
**Description**: Is an engine for running timed processes. It outputs channels such as timing fractions, counters, pulses and timer states, and it calls python functions (callbacks) when various timing events occur.
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Timer.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Touch In

**Category**: General
**Description**: Can be used to create a high speed connection between two TouchDesigner processes via CHOPs. Data is sent over TCP/IP.
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Touch_In.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Touch Out

**Category**: General
**Description**: Can be used to create high speed connection between two TouchDesigner processes. Data is sent over TCP/IP.
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Touch_Out.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Trail

**Category**: General
**Description**: Displays a history of its input channels back in time. A window of time is displayed from the current frame back in time, the size of this window is set by the Window Length parameter.
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Trail.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Transform

**Category**: General
**Description**: Takes translate, rotate, and/or scale channels and transforms them using the transform parameters in the CHOP.
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Transform.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Trigger

**Category**: General
**Description**: Starts an audio-style attack/decay/sustain/release (ADSR) envelope to all trigger pulses in the input channels.
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Trigger.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Trim

**Category**: General
**Description**: Shortens or lengthens the input's channels. A part of the interval can be preserved or removed. If the channels are being lengthened, the extend conditions of the channel will be used to get the new values.
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Trim.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Warp

**Category**: General
**Description**: Time-warps the channels of the first input (the Pre-Warp Channels) using one warping channel in the second input (the Warp Curve).
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Warp.md)
**Related**: _To be added_

#### Wave

**Category**: General
**Description**: Makes repeating waves with a variety of shapes. It is by default 10-seconds of 1-second sine waves, a total of 600 frames.
**Documentation**: [Full Details](./Wave.md)
**Related**: _To be added_
