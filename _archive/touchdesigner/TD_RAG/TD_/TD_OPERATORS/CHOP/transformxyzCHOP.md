# CHOP transformxyzCHOP

## Overview

Transforms positions and vectors.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Label | Type | Description |
|-----------|-------|------|-------------|
| `input0type` | Input 0 Type | Menu | Choose if the input 0 values should be treated as a position or a vectors. Vectors will not have the translation portion of the transform applied to them, and can be normalized before and/or after ... |
| `innormalize` | Normalize | Toggle | If the input is vectors, they can be normalized before the transformation is applied. |
| `custinputorder` | Custom Input Order | Toggle | This allows the input order for input 1, if provided, to be ignored and overridden by a custom order chosen by the following two parameters. |
| `inxord` | Transform Order | Menu | Changing the Transform order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block. In matrix math t... |
| `inrord` | Rotate Order | Menu | As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the rotations take place will alter the final position and orientation. A Rotation order of Rx Ry Rz would create the final rotation mat... |
| `input1preop` | Input 1 Pre Operation | Menu | Operation(s) to apply on the transforms on Input 1, before they are combined with other transforms. |
| `xord` | Transform Order | Menu | See description from earlier Transform Order parameter. |
| `rord` | Rotate Order | Menu | See description from earlier Rotate Order parameter. |
| `t` | Translate | XYZ | XYZ translation values. |
| `r` | Rotate | XYZ | XYZ rotation, in degrees. |
| `s` | Scale | XYZ | XYZ scale to shrink or enlarge the transform. |
| `p` | Pivot | XYZ | XYZ pivot to apply the above operations around. |
| `preop` | Pre Operation | Toggle | Turn this on to invert the transform generated by this page before combining it with the other terms. |
| `multiplyorder` | Multiply Order | Menu | Controls how the input transform(s) are combined with the transform specified on this page. The below two descriptions use a multiply "vector on the right" convention (column vectors). |
| `unmatchedchans` | Un-matched Channels | Menu | Controls how channels that don't match the naming convention for the various transform format are treated. |
| `normalize` | Normalize | Toggle | If the input data is being treated as vectors, they can be re-normalized after the transform by turning this on. |
| `timeslice` | Time Slice | Toggle | Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced".  A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame. |
| `scope` | Scope | StrMenu | To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See :Pattern Matching. |
| `srselect` | Sample Rate Match | Menu | Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate... |
| `exportmethod` | Export Method | Menu | This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information. |
| `autoexportroot` | Export Root | OP | This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to. |
| `exporttable` | Export Table | DAT | The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above). |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
# Access the CHOP transformxyzCHOP operator
transformxyzchop_op = op('transformxyzchop1')

# Get/set parameters
freq_value = transformxyzchop_op.par.active.eval()
transformxyzchop_op.par.active = 1
```

### In Networks

```python
# Connect operators
input_op = op('source1')
transformxyzchop_op = op('transformxyzchop1')
output_op = op('output1')

transformxyzchop_op.inputConnectors[0].connect(input_op)
output_op.inputConnectors[0].connect(transformxyzchop_op)
```
