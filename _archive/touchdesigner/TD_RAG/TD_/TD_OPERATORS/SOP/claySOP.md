# SOP claySOP

## Overview

The Clay SOP deforms faces and surfaces by pulling points that lie directly on them.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Label | Type | Description |
|-----------|-------|------|-------------|
| `group` | Group | StrMenu | If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in Pattern Matching in the [Scripting Guide]. |
| `method` | Warp Method | Menu | The following describe the four types of transformations the Clay SOP can apply to the target (U, V) points or isoparametric curves (U or V). All the transformations are exclusive, and all reduce t... |
| `xord` | Transform Order | Menu | Sets the overall transform order for the transformations. The transform order determines the order in which transformations take place. Depending on the order, you can achieve different results usi... |
| `rord` | Rotate Order | Menu | Sets the order of the rotations within the overall transform order. |
| `t` | Translate | XYZ | These three fields move the Source geometry in the three axes. |
| `r` | Rotate | XYZ | These three fields rotate the Source geometry in the three axes. |
| `s` | Scale | XYZ | These three fields scale the Source geometry in the three axes. |
| `p` | Pivot | XYZ | The pivot point for the transformations (not the same as the pivot point in the pivot channels). The pivot point parameters allow you to define the point about which geometry scales and rotates. Al... |
| `dist` | Distance | Float | Specifies the translation distance along the given vector. |
| `normal` | Normal | Toggle | When On, the translation will be performed along the primitive normal at the target (U, V) point. Otherwise an explicit direction is required, see Direction parameter below. If the input contains f... |
| `dir` | Direction | XYZ | The direction of the vector is the Normal parameter above is Off. |
| `coord` | Coordinates | XYZ | Specifies the absolute 3D location the (U, V) target must translate to. |
| `uvsnap` | U and V | Float | The primitive method allows the target point to be snapped to a point on another primitive specified by U and V here. See Warp Method parameter for details. |
| `uwarp` | Deform along U | Toggle | Determines whether the clay operation affects the U parametric direction. Both faces and surfaces respond to this option. If the primitives are face types and the toggle is off, clay doesn't change... |
| `u` | U | Float | This value defines a point in the parametric space of a face, representing the location to be affected by the clay operation. This location is referred to as the "target". For surfaces, U defines a... |
| `uusebias` | U Bias | Toggle | Indicates whether the clay algorithm should use the bias it thinks works best for the given U parameter, or take the value explicitly stated beside the toggle. Since clay affects the CVs in the nei... |
| `ubias` | U Bias | Float |  |
| `usharp` | U Sharpness | Float | This parameter affects only NURBS curves and surfaces. The pull generated by clay on these primitives can be smooth or sharp depending on the position of the target relative to the underlying domai... |
| `vwarp` | Deform along V | Toggle | Determines whether the clay operation affects the V parametric direction of the surface. If the inputs are surfaces and V if off, clay will pull the surfaces along the entire U direction (if U is o... |
| `v` | V | Float | This value affects only surface types. V defines a line of constant value in the parametric space of the surface and together with U specifies a unique location in that space. Spline surfaces have ... |
| `vusebias` | V Bias | Toggle | Indicates whether the clay algorithm should use the bias it thinks works best for the given V parameter, or take the value explicitly stated beside the toggle. Since clay affects the CVs in the nei... |
| `vbias` | V Bias | Float |  |
| `vsharp` | V Sharpness | Float | This parameter affects only NURBS surfaces. The pull generated by clay on these primitives can be smooth or sharp depending on the position of the target relative to the underlying domain (the fart... |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
# Access the SOP claySOP operator
claysop_op = op('claysop1')

# Get/set parameters
freq_value = claysop_op.par.active.eval()
claysop_op.par.active = 1
```

### In Networks

```python
# Connect operators
input_op = op('source1')
claysop_op = op('claysop1')
output_op = op('output1')

claysop_op.inputConnectors[0].connect(input_op)
output_op.inputConnectors[0].connect(claysop_op)
```
