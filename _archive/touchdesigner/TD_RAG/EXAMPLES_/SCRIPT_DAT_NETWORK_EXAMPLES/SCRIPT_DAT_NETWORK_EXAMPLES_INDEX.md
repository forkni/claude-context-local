# Script DAT Network Examples Index

This section contains examples specifically demonstrating the power and flexibility of the `scriptDAT` for procedural data generation, filtering, and manipulation.

## Examples

- **[Common Table Operations](./Common_Operations.md)**
  - Learn the basics of creating and modifying tables from scratch using Python.

- **[Copy Inputs and Iterate Rows](./Copy_Inputs_and_Iterate_Rows.md)**
  - A fundamental pattern for processing data from an input table by iterating through its rows.

- **[Exclude Rows by Parameter](./Exclude_Rows_by_Parameter.md)**
  - An interactive filtering example where rows are excluded based on keywords provided in a custom parameter.

- **[Iterate and Compare All Cells](./Iterate_and_Compare_Cells.md)**
  - Demonstrates how to transform data in every cell and how to compare two tables to find differences.

- **[Iterate Input Rows](./Iterate_Input_Rows.md)**
  - Shows two different methods for looping through table rows: one for simple iteration and one for more flexible access by column name.

- **[Generate Random Numbers](./Generate_Random_Numbers.md)**
  - A procedural example of generating random numbers, controlled by a custom parameter.

- **[Replace Rows](./Replace_Rows.md)**
  - A powerful data merging technique to update a primary table with override data from a secondary table.

- **[Shuffle Cell Contents](./Shuffle_Cell_Contents.md)**
  - A generative text example that shuffles the characters in each cell, controlled by a repeatable random seed.
