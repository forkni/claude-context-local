## Introduction

The System Monitor is a diagnostic tool designed to help developers and artists identify performance bottlenecks and memory leaks within a TouchDesigner project. It provides both a high-level overview of system-wide resource usage and a precision tool for tracking down memory consumption on a per-operator basis.

This component is designed to be portable; you can drop it into any part of your network to analyze that specific section, making it invaluable for debugging large and complex projects.

## Features

- **System Health Overview:** Monitors system-wide CPU, RAM, GPU Utilization, and GPU Memory usage.
- **Targeted Memory Leak Detection:** Logs the specific CPU memory usage of individual operators within a defined scope, allowing you to pinpoint the source of a leak over time.
- **Configurable Search Scope:** The memory logging can be targeted to the component's parent container with a user-defined search depth.
- **Manual Memory Release:** Includes a function to manually trigger Python's garbage collector to free up unreferenced memory.
- **UI-Driven Controls:** All major functions are controlled via custom parameters on the component's UI.

## Setup and Configuration

For the component to function correctly, it must contain the following internal operators with these exact names:

### Internal Operators

- `SystemMonitorExt` ([CLASS_TextDAT_Class](CLASS_TextDAT_Class.md)): Contains the main Python extension class.
- `SystemStats` ([CLASS_TableDAT_Class](CLASS_TableDAT_Class.md)): Displays the general system health snapshot.
- `OperatorMemoryLog` ([CLASS_TableDAT_Class](CLASS_TableDAT_Class.md)): Logs the memory usage of individual operators over time.
- `parexec1` ([CLASS_ParameterExecuteDAT_Class](CLASS_ParameterExecuteDAT_Class.md)): Handles the UI button controls.
- `timer1` ([CLASS_TimerCHOP_Class](CLASS_TimerCHOP_Class.md)): Drives the periodic logging.
- `timer_callbacks` ([CLASS_ExecuteDAT_Class](CLASS_ExecuteDAT_Class.md)): Script that runs when the timer1 completes a cycle.
- `on_exit_callbacks` ([CLASS_ExecuteDAT_Class](CLASS_ExecuteDAT_Class.md)): Ensures clean shutdown when the project closes.

### External Dependencies

This component requires two external Python libraries. You must install them into TouchDesigner's Python environment for the component to work.

**psutil:** For accessing system and process information.

```bash
# In a command prompt/terminal
pip install psutil
```

**pynvml:** For accessing NVIDIA GPU information. **Note:** This is for NVIDIA GPUs only.

```bash
# In a command prompt/terminal
pip install pynvml
```

## Component Parameters

The component is controlled by a set of custom parameters, typically found on a "Settings" or "Actions" page.

| Parameter Label | par.Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Log Threshold (KB) | `Logthreshold` | Sets the minimum memory usage (in Kilobytes) an operator must have to be included in the OperatorMemoryLog. Lower this to 1 or 5 to detect slow leaks. |
| Search Depth | `Searchdepth` | Controls how many levels deep the logger will search from its parent container. A value of 1 checks only the direct children. |
| Resource Snapshot | `Resoursesnapshot` | (Pulse) Manually updates the SystemStats table and prints the results to the Textport. |
| Release Memory | `Releasememory` | (Pulse) Manually triggers Python's garbage collector to free unreferenced memory. |
| Clear Operator Log | `Clearlog` | (Pulse) Clears all data from the OperatorMemoryLog table to start a fresh session. |

## Usage Instructions

This is the primary workflow for diagnosing a slow memory leak:

1. **Place the Component:** Drag the `SystemMonitorExt` component inside the container ([CLASS_BaseCOMP_Class](CLASS_BaseCOMP_Class.md) or [CLASS_ContainerCOMP_Class](CLASS_ContainerCOMP_Class.md)) where you suspect the leak is occurring.

2. **Configure Parameters:**
   - Set the `Log Threshold (KB)` to a low value, like 5.
   - Set the `Search Depth` to a value that covers the complexity of the container you are analyzing (e.g., 3 or 4).

3. **Start Monitoring:** The [CLASS_TimerCHOP_Class](CLASS_TimerCHOP_Class.md) inside the component should be running. It will automatically trigger the `log_operator_memory` function at its set interval.

4. **Wait and Observe:** Let your project run for an extended period (several hours or more). The `OperatorMemoryLog` DAT will gradually accumulate data.

5. **Analyze the Results:**
   - Right-click the `OperatorMemoryLog` DAT and save its contents as a `.csv` file.
   - Open the `.csv` file in a spreadsheet application (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.).
   - Sort the data by the `path` column, then by the `timestamp` column.
   - Look for an operator whose `cpu_memory_kb` value consistently increases with each timestamp. This is the source of your leak.

## Output Tables

### SystemStats Table DAT

This table provides a high-level snapshot of your system's health. It is useful for understanding the overall context in which your project is running.

- `td_process_memory` - The RAM used by the TouchDesigner process only.
- `system_cpu_usage` - Total CPU usage by all applications.
- `system_ram_usage` - Total RAM usage by all applications.
- `gpu_utilization` - Total workload on the GPU.
- `gpu_memory_usage` - Total VRAM used on the GPU.

### OperatorMemoryLog Table DAT

This is the precision tool for finding leaks. It logs the memory usage of individual operators over time.

- `path` - The full path to the operator.
- `name` - The name of the operator.
- `cpu_memory_kb` - The operator's specific CPU memory usage in Kilobytes. This is the value to watch for increases.
- `timestamp` - The time the log entry was recorded.

## Troubleshooting

**Error on Startup: "Table DAT not found":** This means the extension initialized before the required [CLASS_TableDAT_Class](CLASS_TableDAT_Class.md)]s (`SystemStats`, `OperatorMemoryLog`) were created or named correctly. Ensure the nodes exist with the correct names inside the component and re-initialize the extension by pulsing the `Re-Init Extensions` parameter on the component's "Extensions" page.

**OperatorMemoryLog is empty:** The `Log Threshold (KB)` parameter is likely set too high. Lower it to a smaller value to capture operators with low memory usage.
