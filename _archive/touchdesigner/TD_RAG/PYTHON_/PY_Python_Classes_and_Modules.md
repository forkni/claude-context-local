## Summary

Comprehensive index document listing all Python classes and modules available in TouchDesigner. Serves as a master reference and navigation aid for the entire Python API.

## Relationship Justification

Serves as comprehensive complement to Python Reference. Strong connection to td module as the core. Medium connections to major class examples to provide entry points into specific documentation.

The following list of important Python classes and modules is roughly grouped together by subject:
[Python Reference](PY_Python_Reference.md)

Python Reference has an alphabetical list of all TouchDesigner Python pages on this wiki.

Individual operator classes (e.g. TextTOP Class and RampTOP Class) are not listed but do exist in the td module, and links to each can be found here or by clicking on the Python Help button in their parameter dialog. These classes are found in the td module so do not need to be imported.
