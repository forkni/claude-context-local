## Introduction

Texturing in GLSL can be performed in different ways. This article explores the differences between the `texelFetch()` and `texture()` functions in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language).

GLSL is one of the most powerful tools for visual development. It is a C-style language that performs high-level operations on shaders - functions that calculate position and color of pixels. In TouchDesigner, we can leverage GLSL through the dedicated [CLASS_GLSLTOP] operator.

## The texture() Function

### Characteristics

`texture()` is the most commonly used function for texturing in GLSL. It allows us to handle filtered and normalized textures in the 0-1 domain.

Key features of `texture()`:

- Works with normalized floating point texture coordinates between 0 and 1
- Coordinates range from left to bottom and right to top
- Can perform wrapping - coordinates can exceed the 0-1 range
- Performs filtering and interpolation
- Infinitely interpolating

### Usage Example

The `texture()` function requires two arguments: the texture (sampler2D) and the UV coordinate to sample.

```glsl
in vec2 TexCoords; //uv coordinates
out vec4 FragColor;
uniform sampler2D myTexture; //the texture

void main() {
    vec4 texColor = texture(myTexture, TexCoords);
    FragColor = texColor;
}
```

`texture()` is the traditional approach to texturing in GLSL. However, sometimes we need to perform operations in the integer domain, which is where `texelFetch()` becomes useful.

## The texelFetch() Function

### Key Differences

`texelFetch()` has several important differences from `texture()`:

- Accesses a texel (texture element) directly
- Does not perform filtering or wrapping
- Works with non-normalized coordinates
- Operates in texture integer coordinates rather than the 0-1 domain

### Usage Example

For example, to access a texel in the middle of a 512Ã—512 texture:

- `texture()` coordinates: (0.5, 0.5)
- `texelFetch()` coordinates: (256, 256)

The `texelFetch()` function takes three arguments:

1. The texture (sampler2D)
2. The UV coordinate in integer pixels
3. The LOD (Level of Detail) - the mipmap level (use 0 for original size)

```glsl
in vec2 TexCoords; //uv coordinates
out vec4 FragColor;
uniform sampler2D myTexture; //the texture
uniform ivec2 textureSize; //the texture size

void main() {
    ivec2 texelCoord = ivec2(TexCoords * vec2(textureSize)); //convert uv coordinates to integer pixels
    vec4 texColor = texelFetch(myTexture, texelCoord, 0);
    FragColor = texColor;
}
```

## Comparison: texture() vs texelFetch()

### Coordinate Systems

| Function | Coordinate System | Range |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| `texture()` | Normalized floating point | 0.0 to 1.0 |
| `texelFetch()` | Integer pixels | 0 to texture size |

### Filtering and Interpolation

| Function | Filtering | Interpolation | Wrapping |
|----------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| `texture()` | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `texelFetch()` | No | No | No |

### Use Cases

**Use `texture()` when:**

- Working with normalized UV coordinates
- Filtering and interpolation are desired
- Wrapping behavior is needed
- Working with mipmaps

**Use `texelFetch()` when:**

- Precise texel access is required
- No interpolation is wanted
- Working with integer pixel coordinates
- Implementing algorithms that require exact pixel values

## When to Use Each Function

`texelFetch()` is particularly advantageous in several scenarios:

- **Precise Texel Access**: When you need to access a specific texel or array of texels without interpolation
- **No Mipmaps**: When you don't need mipmaps and want to access the texture layer without changes
- **Advanced Techniques**: When working with techniques that require access to specific pixels, such as:
  - Path tracing
  - Advanced simulations
  - Data processing applications
  - Computer vision algorithms

## Conclusion

Texturing is the foundation of working with GLSL in TouchDesigner. Understanding the differences between `texture()` and `texelFetch()` is crucial for maximizing project efficiency. Each function serves different purposes:

- `texture()` provides the traditional, interpolated approach suitable for most rendering scenarios
- `texelFetch()` offers precise, unfiltered access ideal for computational and data-processing tasks

By choosing the appropriate function for your specific needs, you can optimize both performance and visual quality in your [CLASS_GLSLTOP] implementations.
